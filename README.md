# dux_project

Dux is a mobile app designed to connect travelers with locals for a unique and immersive 
travel experience, fostering genuine connections, and gaining local insights.

There are two types of users that the app caters to: Tourists (people who are looking 
for a personalized tour guide), Tour Guides (people who earn money through guiding tourists).
Users can switch between these two types by selecting the role they want to use the
app from the home page. They are then redirected to a profile page where they put in
their details; these details and preferences will be used in order to match the tourists
and tour guides. There is also a notification page that informs the matched users whom
they have been matched with.

The front end was built using Flutter and Dart
The back end was built using Firebase

In order to be able to use the app some dependencies will need to be downloaded:
  ** flutter
  ** cocoa pods
